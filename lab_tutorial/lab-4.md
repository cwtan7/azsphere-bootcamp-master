# Lab-4: Visualize real world data on Azure IoT Central

- Go to [Home Page](../README.md)

## Goals

- Hands-on with Azure IoT Central configuration
- Understand the basic feature of IoT Central offered as a IoT SaaS solution
- Get familiar with I2C API to connect to external sensor device
- Use Azure Sphere and Azure IoT Central work together to build a secured end-to-end solution with telemtery collection, visulization and remote control ability.

## Steps

1. After connect Azure Sphere development board to your PC, enable device debug and disable OTA in Azure Sphere utility
   
   `azsphere device enable-development`

2. Make sure WiFi credential is configured and Azure Sphere is connected to the WiFi Access Point. If Lab-2 is skipped, please follow Step 1) and 2) in [Over-The-Air upgrade](lab-2.md) to configure the WiFi.
   
3. Please follow the following link [Setup IoT Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/setup-iot-central) to setup the cloud resources, the importants steps are:
    
    - Login to Azure IoT Central with your Azure credentials
	- Create an Azure IoT Central Application
    - Upload tenant CA certificate to IoT Central and finish Proof of Procession

4. Next is to create a device template in IoT Central.  Go to your application in [Azure IoT Central](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/) and select Device Templates page under the application section.  Create a custom device template by choosing the **IoT Device** as a start.

5. Click **Next: Customize** and in the next page, leave the **Gateway device** unchecked; click on **Next: Review** --> finally **Create** the custom template.  Enter a name for your template, such as **Sensor Hub*.

6. You also need to create a device capability model and add a set of custom interface for your device.  Make use of the telemetry data to tabulate the device capabilities and the associated interfaces.  See following example: -

	![](../img/lab-4/iotcentral_capabilities_1.png)
	![](../img/lab-4/iotcentral_capabilities_2.png)

7.  You may use the general default view or add your own customization and selecting the various dashboard views. Before you can connect a device that implements your device capability model, you must publish your device template.  To publish a device template, go to you your device template, and select Publish.

8. After you had published your newly created template, its time to create your new device. On the left hand side of the navigation pane, selectÂ Devices, click **+** to add a new device.  Please select the template that you have just published and give a name to the new device. Finally, fill in the Device ID. 

	Please use the following command to get the Device ID:

	`powershell -Command ((azsphere device show-attached)[0] -split ': ')[1].ToLower()`

	Copy the lowercase device ID and paste it into the Device ID field of the Create New Device dialog box. Cick Create.

9. After you have created the new device, please select the device and click on "Approve" then follow by "Migrate" where you will now associate the Device with the device template that was just created / published. Once you have done associating it, the Device Status will show as "Registered".

10. In Visual Studio, please select to open a folder and navigate to the folder of *.\azure-sphere-samples\Samples\AzureIoT*, click **Select Folder** to open the CMake project.
   
11. Before proceed to building the project, there are three key information that need to be provided to the applicaton via the app_manifest.json file.
   
	- **The Tenant ID of Azure Sphere device** - At the Azure Sphere CLI, use the following command to get the tenant ID. Copy the returned value and paste it into the DeviceAuthentication field of the app_manifest.json file:

	   `azsphere tenant show-selected`
	   
	- **Scope ID** for your Azure IoT Central application can be found in the Administration --> Device Connection page of IoT Central.

	- **IoT Hub URL** for your Azure IoT Central application. In order to get this **IoT Hub URL**, there is a need for a tool in *.\azure-sphere-samples\Samples\AzureIoT\Tools* folder that can help. In Azure Sphere command line utility, go to above location, and run `ShowIoTCentralConfig.exe`, input 'Y' and provide the following information

		1. Scope ID
		2. Device ID
		3. The Device SAS Primary Key - can be found in the **Devices** page, select the specific device to go into the device page, and click on **Connect** at the top right.

		> **Alternatively**: you may want to consider using the web tool [Azure IoT Central Connection String Generator](https://dpsgen.z8.web.core.windows.net)
		
		Once all the required fields have been entered, the output result will be the **IoT Hub URL**  
	
		![](../img/lab-4/iotcentral_configtool.png)

    - Double click the app_manifest.json file in Solution Explorer and tabulate all the **3 important** fields (Tenant ID, Scope ID and IoT Hub URL) into the app_manifest.json and save the modified file.

12. Last step to modify the source codes before we start compiling
	- Please download the [MEMS Sensors (LSM6DSO and LPS22HH) and I2C driver](../src/lab-4/sensorhub_lsm6ds0_lps22hh) source / header files and copy into the project folder root directory.
	- Please update the CMake list file ("CMakeLists.txt") to add i2cDevice.c, lps22hh_reg.c and lsm6dso_reg.c to the ADD_EXECUTABLE parameter. 
	- If you're using **AVNET_MT3620_SK** devkit, follow Step 4 in [Lab-1](lab-1.md) to modify target hardware definition file.
	- Grant ISU2 I2C access permission to application in app_manifest.json
	
	  ![](../img/lab-4/iotcentral_manifest_isu2.png)
		 
	- Last but not least, you will need to make changes to the code to visualize your real world data by 
	
		1. Iniitializing the I2C Driver and Sensor Hub during peripheral initialization.
		2. Replacing the functions that send simulated data with the Sensor Hub API to send live telemetry data to IoT Central.
				
			> **HINT:** `initI2cDevice()` and  `SensorHub_SendData()`
		
		**NOTE:** Alternatively, the answer is found in a git patch. You can also apply the patch [0001-AzSphere_Tutorial-Lab-4-Answers.patch](../src/lab-4/answer) and study the code changes directly.  Please use the following git command to apply a patch
		
			`git apply <patch_file>`

13. After finishing all the configuration and code changes, select **GDB Debugger (HLCore)** and Press F5 to build and run the applicaiton. Go to the device dashboard to check your data.
